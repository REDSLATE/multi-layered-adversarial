# CHANGELOG — RiseDual Mission Control

Append-only. Newest at top.

## 2026-02-14 — AI Investment Hypothesis Engine (Adversarial Two-AI)

Standalone research tool at `/admin/hypothesis`. Operator types a ticker → MC runs **Strategist (Claude Sonnet 4.5)** + **Auditor (Gemini 3 Flash)** LLM calls IN PARALLEL, anchored to MC's live indicator snapshots / open positions / recent intents.

**Backend additions:**
- `/app/backend/shared/auditor_seat.py` — rotatable Auditor seat (mirrors Executor seat). `GET /api/auditor`, `POST /api/auditor/rotate`, `GET /api/auditor/audit`
- `/app/backend/shared/hypothesis.py` — `POST /api/hypothesis/analyze {symbol}` and `GET /api/hypothesis/recent`. Strict-JSON LLM contract; parses tolerantly (handles markdown fences); per-brain persona injection
- Brain holding the Executor seat plays Strategist. Brain holding the Auditor seat plays Auditor. Empty seat = neutral analyst voice. Persona blurbs encoded for ALPHA/CAMARO/CHEVELLE/REDEYE
- New collections: `shared_auditor_seat`, `shared_auditor_rotations`, `hypothesis_analyses`

**Frontend additions:**
- `/app/frontend/src/pages/Hypothesis.jsx` (~430 lines): search bar (hamburger-style with magnifier icon), Analyze button, Clear button, dual cards — **Strategist (green-left-accent)** + **Auditor (red-left-accent)** — collapsible sections mirroring the risedual.ai War Room screenshots: Short-term target / Medium-term target / Investment Thesis / Strategist Catalysts; Auditor Risk Flags / What could go wrong / Kill-switch Triggers
- Client-side 30-min `Map<symbol, {result, expiresAt}>` cache — survives route changes but not refreshes; cache count + TTL shown in header; "CACHED · expires in Xm" badge when serving from memory
- `Hypothesis` nav item in admin sidebar with Sparkle icon

**Verified end-to-end:**
- NVDA fresh analyze: 16s wall time. Strategist returned BUY 72% with 6 catalysts; Auditor returned BORDERLINE with 3 risk flags + 4 explicit kill-switch triggers (e.g., "exit if last_close breaks below $882.82")
- TSLA fresh: 14.1s. Cached repeat: 0.25s (~56× speedup). CACHED badge confirms
- Both LLMs grounded — when TSLA has no indicator snapshot, Auditor correctly flags context-blindness as a risk
- All 14/14 unit tests (alpaca + execution_gates) still pass

**Initial seat assignment:**
- Executor: CAMARO (held since 2026-02-13 from prior session)
- Auditor: REDEYE (newly assigned 2026-02-14)
- Both rotatable by operator via `POST /api/{executor,auditor}/rotate`



## 2026-02-14 — Alpaca Paper Broker + Real Execution Pipeline (Week 1, Day 1)

MC now owns a broker. Intents that pass the full gate chain route to **Alpaca paper** as $10 notional market-day orders. No brain ever sees broker keys.

**New backend modules:**
- `/app/backend/shared/broker/__init__.py`, `base.py`, `alpaca.py`, `alpaca_routes.py` — `BrokerAdapter` ABC + `AlpacaPaperAdapter` (wraps `alpaca-py 0.43.4`, `paper=True` hard-coded) + admin connect/status/test/account/positions/orders/disconnect endpoints
- `/app/backend/shared/exposure_caps.py` — hardcoded rails: **$10/order, $50/day, $100 open notional**. No operator surface to relax them (change-and-redeploy)
- `/app/backend/shared/execution.py` — full 8-gate chain (schema_invariants · action_routable · executor_seat_check · live_trading_disabled · broker_connected · cap_per_order · cap_per_day · cap_open_notional) + `/api/execution/{dry_run, submit, receipts, caps}`. Submit requires `confirm="execute"` and stamps an execution receipt; intents are idempotent (409 on re-submit)

**New endpoints:**
- `POST /api/admin/alpaca/connect` — Fernet-encrypted key storage; probes ping BEFORE persisting
- `GET  /api/admin/alpaca/status` — redacted preview + last_ping
- `POST /api/admin/alpaca/test` — cheap broker ping
- `GET  /api/admin/alpaca/{account,positions,orders}` — broker reads
- `DELETE /api/admin/alpaca/{disconnect,orders/<id>,positions/<symbol>}`
- `POST /api/execution/dry_run?intent_id=&order_notional_usd=` — gate chain evaluation only
- `POST /api/execution/submit` — gated order routing, `confirm="execute"` required
- `GET  /api/execution/{receipts,caps}` — operator visibility

**Frontend:**
- `/app/frontend/src/components/AlpacaConnect.jsx` — credentials modal + status tile, mounted on `/admin/intents` below the Executor Seat tile. Shows acct, equity, daily-spend / cap, open-notional / cap, last-ping
- `/app/frontend/src/pages/Intents.jsx` — each intent row gains a **submit** button when gate_state is dry_run_passed/passed; executed intents show a green executed badge with the broker_order_id in the detail panel
- `/app/frontend/src/lib/api.js` — fetch wrapper now surfaces backend `detail` strings in `err.message` (no more "HTTP 400" placeholder)

**DB collections:**
- `alpaca_credentials` (singleton, Fernet-encrypted at rest)
- `alpaca_audit_log` (every state change)
- `execution_receipts` (one row per routed order)

**Tests:**
- `tests/test_alpaca_broker.py` — 6 unit tests (mocked SDK)
- `tests/test_execution_gates.py` — 8 gate-chain unit tests
- testing-agent integration suite: 10/10 new + 14/14 unit pass

**Doctrine preserved:**
- Brains do NOT execute. Only MC routes orders.
- Executor seat held + still held = required at submit time. Stale rotations block.
- LIVE_TRADING_ENABLED stays False. Live broker is a separate adapter.



## 2026-02-13 — Patch distribution channel + Decision Machine v1.0

MC now serves drop-in code patches over HTTPS. Brains pull their own updates via `X-Runtime-Token` auth — no copy-paste required. First patch published: **Decision Machine** (intent envelopes).

**New endpoints:**
- `GET  /api/patches` — list available patches
- `GET  /api/patches/{name}/manifest` — file list with sha256 + bytes
- `GET  /api/patches/{name}/file/{filepath:path}` — raw file content + sha256
- `GET  /api/patches/install.sh` — bash installer (curl-pipe-bash compatible)
- `POST /api/intents` — brain emits an intent envelope (schema-pinned safety)
- `GET  /api/intents` — read intents (any brain token or admin)
- `POST /api/admin/intents` — operator proxy emission
- `POST /api/execution/dry_run` — runs gate chain stub against an intent_id

**One-liner install** from any brain:
```bash
curl -s "$MC/api/patches/install.sh" -H "X-Runtime-Token: $TOKEN" \
  | bash -s -- decision_machine ./services
```

**Files added:**
- `/app/backend/shared/intents.py` — intent ingest + dry-run gate chain stub
- `/app/backend/shared/patches.py` — patch distribution + audit log
- `/app/runtime_patch_kit/decision_machine/decision_machine.py` — brain-side module
- `/app/runtime_patch_kit/decision_machine/DECISION_MACHINE_PATCH.md` — doctrine + how-to
- `/app/runtime_patch_kit/install_patch.sh` — bash installer with sha256 verification

**Doctrine:**
- Brains emit INTENTS, not orders. `may_execute=true` rejected at schema layer (422).
- `requires_gate_pass=true` schema-pinned. `seat_at_post_time` MC-stamped from live seat policy.
- Token-stack mismatch (alpha posting as camaro) returns 401.
- Patch distribution audit-logged in `shared_patch_pulls` (caller, patch, file, ts).
- Feature flag `DECISION_MACHINE_ENABLED` controls brain-side activation; flip to false = instant rollback.

**Verified end-to-end:** Camaro pulled the installer via curl-pipe-bash, both files written with sha256 match, `decision_machine.py` imports cleanly, audit log captured both pulls.

**New collections:**
- `shared_intents` — intent envelopes
- `shared_gate_results` — placeholder for Day 2 gate audit
- `shared_patch_pulls` — patch distribution audit

## 2026-02-13 — Route swap: public site to `/`, operator to `/admin`

Flipped the mount points so the consumer-facing RiseDual site is the root experience and the MC operator dashboard moved under `/admin/*`. Forward-compatible with the future `risedual.ai` DNS flip — no further URL changes needed.

**Routes after swap:**
- `/` → public RiseDual site (was `/r`)
- `/signals`, `/markets`, `/scanner`, `/heatmap`, `/activity`, `/digest`, `/chat`, `/signals/:id`
- `/r` and `/r/*` → 301 redirect to root (backward-compat for any bookmark)
- `/admin` → operator Overview (was `/`)
- `/admin/brain/:brain`, `/admin/promotion`, `/admin/discussion`, etc. — all operator paths re-prefixed
- `/login` — unchanged. Redirect after login: `/` → `/admin`.

**Files changed:**
- `App.js` — route table flipped
- `Layout.jsx` (operator) — `NAV` + `RUNTIMES` arrays re-pointed to `/admin/...`
- `Login.jsx` — post-login nav target → `/admin`
- `BrainConsole.jsx`, `RuntimeDetail.jsx`, `Redeye.jsx`, `Overview.jsx` — internal `<Link to>` and back-buttons updated
- All `risedual/**` pages — internal `/r/*` links rewritten to `/*`

**Verified live:** 7/7 swap tests pass — root renders public landing, `/r` redirects, `/admin` requires auth, login lands at `/admin`, `/admin/brain/camaro` renders console, `/signals` serves public page.

## 2026-02-13 — Brain Console pages (`/brain/:brain`)

User requested per-brain operator pages modeled after REDEYE's screenshot. Built one unified `BrainConsole.jsx` parameterized by brain name — same layout, different data per route.

**Routes shipped:**
- `/brain/alpha` · `/brain/camaro` · `/brain/chevelle` · `/brain/redeye`
- Sidebar `RUNTIMES` nav re-pointed from `/runtime/:r` + `/redeye` → `/brain/:b` uniformly
- Old routes (`/runtime/:runtime`, `/redeye`) kept for backward compatibility

**Sections per page:**
- Header (label, role, live pulse badge, reload)
- Mission Control Pulse — heartbeat age + sovereign contribution age + last seen + connection state
- Authority — promotion state + pending count + live-exec invariant
- Scorecard — total / wins / losses / win-rate from `/api/shared/scorecard`
- Conflicts — disagreements involving this brain from `/api/shared/conflicts`
- Discussion bus — last 10 opinions from this brain via `/api/shared/opinions`
- Speak as <brain> — admin proxy form (topic / stance / confidence / body)
- Pending approvals — promotion proposals filtered to this brain

**Backend addition:** `POST /api/admin/runtime-discussion/opinion` — admin-authed proxy that posts opinions as any brain without requiring the brain's runtime ingest token client-side. Stamps `posted_via=admin_proxy` + `posted_by_admin_email` in the audit trail.

**Files added:**
- `/app/frontend/src/pages/BrainConsole.jsx`

**Files changed:**
- `/app/backend/shared/opinions.py` — admin proxy endpoint
- `/app/frontend/src/App.js` — `/brain/:brain` route
- `/app/frontend/src/components/Layout.jsx` — sidebar nav re-pointed

**Verified live:** REDEYE shows 39 resolved trades, 51.3% win rate, 5 open AAPL conflicts, live discussion bus with ENDORSE/HYPOTHESIS opinions. Camaro shows active HOLD observation stream every 4-5s, speak-as form, pending challenger→advisor promotion.

## 2026-02-13 — VRL Doctrine Channel (read-only)

Mission Command now serves doctrine packets to all four brains via a read-only HTTP endpoint. First packet published: **Verified Reinforcement Layer (VRL)** — design-only doctrine for future morale/stabilization layer. No implementation yet, awareness only.

**New endpoint:**
- `GET /api/doctrine` — list available packets
- `GET /api/doctrine/{name}` — fetch full markdown for a packet
- Auth: existing `X-Runtime-Token` (any of the four brains' ingest tokens)
- Storage: `/app/runtime_patch_kit/*.md`, registry-gated so only whitelisted files are exposed

**Currently published:**
- `vrl` → `VRL_DOCTRINE.md` (6,125 bytes)
- `discussion_layer` → `DISCUSSION_LAYER_PATCH.md` (9,317 bytes)

**Verified live:** 401 on missing/bad token, 404 on unknown packet, 200 on valid runtime token for all four brains. Read-only — no `POST`/`PUT`/`DELETE`.

**Files added:**
- `/app/backend/shared/doctrine.py`
- `/app/runtime_patch_kit/VRL_DOCTRINE.md`

**Files changed:**
- `/app/backend/server.py` — mounted `doctrine_router`

## 2026-02-13 — Visual polish + candlestick charts (`/r/markets`)

User asked for: (1) softer palette, not so dark; (2) RISEDUAL all caps in logo; (3) candle charts for stocks and crypto. All shipped.

**Palette shift:**
- Bulk-replaced `bg-black` / `bg-zinc-9xx` / `border-zinc-9xx` → slate-based scale (`bg-slate-900` main, `bg-slate-800/40` cards, `border-slate-700`). Subtle navy tint, noticeably lighter and more "fintech" than pure black.

**Logo:**
- `RiseDual` → `RISEDUAL` (uppercase with `tracking-[0.18em]`, emerald `DUAL` accent preserved).

**Candlestick charts (new):**
- Backend: `GET /api/public/bars/{symbol:path}` returns OHLCV bars (newest-last, ascending). `GET /api/public/bars` lists all covered symbols grouped by tf/source.
- Frontend: `lightweight-charts@5.2.0` installed. `CandleChart` component renders candles + volume histogram with emerald/rose up-down coloring, interactive TF selector (1m/5m/15m/1H/4H/1D), pinned `localization.locale="en-US"` to dodge headless-browser locale crash.
- New page: `/r/markets` — symbol picker (Crypto / Stock / Other, ordered) + candle panel. Auto-selects first crypto pair on load.
- Embedded in `/r/signals/:id` under the header as "Price action".
- Nav updated: Home / Signals / **Markets** / Scanner / Heatmap / Activity / Digest / RiseDualGPT.

**Verified live:** BTC/USD on Kraken Pro renders 300 1H bars with last-price tag + volume bars; ETH/USD also wired.

## 2026-02-13 — Public Site Phase 2 (`/r/scanner`, `/r/heatmap`, `/r/activity`, `/r/signals/:id`)

Added the four remaining public surfaces on top of the MVP. Top nav now exposes Home / Signals / Scanner / Heatmap / Activity / Digest / RiseDualGPT.

**Routes shipped:**
- `/r/scanner` — 10 pattern-detection presets (MACD cross, Bollinger squeeze, EMA golden, volume spike, 52w extremes, RSI overbought/oversold, momentum breakout) with live match table.
- `/r/heatmap` — 24h % change grid (color-banded) + SPDR sector rotation rail. Gracefully degrades when feeders haven't accumulated 24h coverage.
- `/r/activity` — Live polled feed (10s) merging position audit / conflicts / outcomes into severity-tagged event cards. Pulse indicator in header.
- `/r/signals/:id` — Adversarial War Room (Bull / Bear / Commander) + Governance Pipeline (Strategist → Auditor → Synthesized) split. Signal cards on `/r/signals` now link here.

**Client changes:**
- `mc.js`: fixed scanner path (`/scanner/scan?preset_id=X`), agent-activity path (`/agent-activity/feed`), added `scannerPresets`, `sectors`, `signal` calls.
- `Signals.jsx`: signal cards now anchor to `/r/signals/:id` with emerald-hover border.

**Files added:**
- `src/risedual/pages/{Scanner,Heatmap,AgentActivity,SignalDetail}.jsx`

**Verification:** lint clean, compile clean, screenshot tested — signal detail renders header + War Room + Pipeline cleanly with live MC data; scanner shows preset list + scan progress; heatmap correctly degrades when feeders lack 24h coverage.

## 2026-02-13 — Public Site MVP (`/r/*`)

Built the consumer-facing `risedual.ai` surface inside MC's React app
(under `/app/frontend/src/risedual/`) so MC owns both backend AND
frontend for the public product. Alpha can be retired as site host when
DNS is flipped.

**Routes shipped:**
- `/r` — Landing (hero, council, features, CTA)
- `/r/signals` — Live signals + AI council consensus (`GET /api/public/signals`)
- `/r/digest` — LLM narrative + predictions table (`GET /api/public/digest/narrative`, `GET /api/public/digest`)
- `/r/chat` — RiseDualGPT chat panel, Pro Max gated (`POST /api/public/chat`)

**Implementation notes:**
- Distinct fintech aesthetic (dark, emerald accents, Chivo display font) — deliberately *not* the operator terminal look.
- Tier selector in header (Free / Starter / Pro / Pro Max) → drives `X-RiseDual-User-Tier` header. Persisted in localStorage as `risedual_site_tier`. Billing/auth stubbed.
- `X-RiseDual-Token` from `REACT_APP_RISEDUAL_TOKEN` (matches MC's `RISEDUAL_PUBLIC_TOKEN`).
- All elements have `data-testid` with `rd-*` prefix.
- Live API verified: consensus hero, signal cards, direction tags, narrative all render with real MC data.

**Files added:**
- `src/risedual/Layout.jsx`
- `src/risedual/context/TierContext.jsx`
- `src/risedual/lib/mc.js`
- `src/risedual/pages/{Landing,Signals,Digest,Chat}.jsx`
- `src/risedual/README.md`

**Files changed:**
- `src/App.js` — mounted `/r/*` route group
- `frontend/.env` — added `REACT_APP_RISEDUAL_TOKEN`

## 2026-02-13 — Unified Sidecar Convergence Patch shipped to brain agents

Delivered 3-block paste-ready patch (heartbeat loop / sovereign contribution loop / discussion-layer methods) to bring all 4 brains to fully-connected status. REDEYE's discussion layer now actively posting opinions to MC.

## 2026-02-13 — REDEYE Discussion Layer Unblocked

Clarified the dual-router quirk: opinions are **posted** to `/api/ingest/opinion` but **read** from `/api/runtime-discussion/opinions`. REDEYE now successfully posting (5+ opinions in 15 min after fix).

## Earlier (see PRD.md for full history)

- Public API Phase 1 + Phase 2 (signals, digest, chat, narrative, scanner, agent activity, models mind, heatmap) — DONE
