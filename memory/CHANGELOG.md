# CHANGELOG — RiseDual Mission Control

Append-only. Newest at top.

## 2026-02-13 — Route swap: public site to `/`, operator to `/admin`

Flipped the mount points so the consumer-facing RiseDual site is the root experience and the MC operator dashboard moved under `/admin/*`. Forward-compatible with the future `risedual.ai` DNS flip — no further URL changes needed.

**Routes after swap:**
- `/` → public RiseDual site (was `/r`)
- `/signals`, `/markets`, `/scanner`, `/heatmap`, `/activity`, `/digest`, `/chat`, `/signals/:id`
- `/r` and `/r/*` → 301 redirect to root (backward-compat for any bookmark)
- `/admin` → operator Overview (was `/`)
- `/admin/brain/:brain`, `/admin/promotion`, `/admin/discussion`, etc. — all operator paths re-prefixed
- `/login` — unchanged. Redirect after login: `/` → `/admin`.

**Files changed:**
- `App.js` — route table flipped
- `Layout.jsx` (operator) — `NAV` + `RUNTIMES` arrays re-pointed to `/admin/...`
- `Login.jsx` — post-login nav target → `/admin`
- `BrainConsole.jsx`, `RuntimeDetail.jsx`, `Redeye.jsx`, `Overview.jsx` — internal `<Link to>` and back-buttons updated
- All `risedual/**` pages — internal `/r/*` links rewritten to `/*`

**Verified live:** 7/7 swap tests pass — root renders public landing, `/r` redirects, `/admin` requires auth, login lands at `/admin`, `/admin/brain/camaro` renders console, `/signals` serves public page.

## 2026-02-13 — Brain Console pages (`/brain/:brain`)

User requested per-brain operator pages modeled after REDEYE's screenshot. Built one unified `BrainConsole.jsx` parameterized by brain name — same layout, different data per route.

**Routes shipped:**
- `/brain/alpha` · `/brain/camaro` · `/brain/chevelle` · `/brain/redeye`
- Sidebar `RUNTIMES` nav re-pointed from `/runtime/:r` + `/redeye` → `/brain/:b` uniformly
- Old routes (`/runtime/:runtime`, `/redeye`) kept for backward compatibility

**Sections per page:**
- Header (label, role, live pulse badge, reload)
- Mission Control Pulse — heartbeat age + sovereign contribution age + last seen + connection state
- Authority — promotion state + pending count + live-exec invariant
- Scorecard — total / wins / losses / win-rate from `/api/shared/scorecard`
- Conflicts — disagreements involving this brain from `/api/shared/conflicts`
- Discussion bus — last 10 opinions from this brain via `/api/shared/opinions`
- Speak as <brain> — admin proxy form (topic / stance / confidence / body)
- Pending approvals — promotion proposals filtered to this brain

**Backend addition:** `POST /api/admin/runtime-discussion/opinion` — admin-authed proxy that posts opinions as any brain without requiring the brain's runtime ingest token client-side. Stamps `posted_via=admin_proxy` + `posted_by_admin_email` in the audit trail.

**Files added:**
- `/app/frontend/src/pages/BrainConsole.jsx`

**Files changed:**
- `/app/backend/shared/opinions.py` — admin proxy endpoint
- `/app/frontend/src/App.js` — `/brain/:brain` route
- `/app/frontend/src/components/Layout.jsx` — sidebar nav re-pointed

**Verified live:** REDEYE shows 39 resolved trades, 51.3% win rate, 5 open AAPL conflicts, live discussion bus with ENDORSE/HYPOTHESIS opinions. Camaro shows active HOLD observation stream every 4-5s, speak-as form, pending challenger→advisor promotion.

## 2026-02-13 — VRL Doctrine Channel (read-only)

Mission Command now serves doctrine packets to all four brains via a read-only HTTP endpoint. First packet published: **Verified Reinforcement Layer (VRL)** — design-only doctrine for future morale/stabilization layer. No implementation yet, awareness only.

**New endpoint:**
- `GET /api/doctrine` — list available packets
- `GET /api/doctrine/{name}` — fetch full markdown for a packet
- Auth: existing `X-Runtime-Token` (any of the four brains' ingest tokens)
- Storage: `/app/runtime_patch_kit/*.md`, registry-gated so only whitelisted files are exposed

**Currently published:**
- `vrl` → `VRL_DOCTRINE.md` (6,125 bytes)
- `discussion_layer` → `DISCUSSION_LAYER_PATCH.md` (9,317 bytes)

**Verified live:** 401 on missing/bad token, 404 on unknown packet, 200 on valid runtime token for all four brains. Read-only — no `POST`/`PUT`/`DELETE`.

**Files added:**
- `/app/backend/shared/doctrine.py`
- `/app/runtime_patch_kit/VRL_DOCTRINE.md`

**Files changed:**
- `/app/backend/server.py` — mounted `doctrine_router`

## 2026-02-13 — Visual polish + candlestick charts (`/r/markets`)

User asked for: (1) softer palette, not so dark; (2) RISEDUAL all caps in logo; (3) candle charts for stocks and crypto. All shipped.

**Palette shift:**
- Bulk-replaced `bg-black` / `bg-zinc-9xx` / `border-zinc-9xx` → slate-based scale (`bg-slate-900` main, `bg-slate-800/40` cards, `border-slate-700`). Subtle navy tint, noticeably lighter and more "fintech" than pure black.

**Logo:**
- `RiseDual` → `RISEDUAL` (uppercase with `tracking-[0.18em]`, emerald `DUAL` accent preserved).

**Candlestick charts (new):**
- Backend: `GET /api/public/bars/{symbol:path}` returns OHLCV bars (newest-last, ascending). `GET /api/public/bars` lists all covered symbols grouped by tf/source.
- Frontend: `lightweight-charts@5.2.0` installed. `CandleChart` component renders candles + volume histogram with emerald/rose up-down coloring, interactive TF selector (1m/5m/15m/1H/4H/1D), pinned `localization.locale="en-US"` to dodge headless-browser locale crash.
- New page: `/r/markets` — symbol picker (Crypto / Stock / Other, ordered) + candle panel. Auto-selects first crypto pair on load.
- Embedded in `/r/signals/:id` under the header as "Price action".
- Nav updated: Home / Signals / **Markets** / Scanner / Heatmap / Activity / Digest / RiseDualGPT.

**Verified live:** BTC/USD on Kraken Pro renders 300 1H bars with last-price tag + volume bars; ETH/USD also wired.

## 2026-02-13 — Public Site Phase 2 (`/r/scanner`, `/r/heatmap`, `/r/activity`, `/r/signals/:id`)

Added the four remaining public surfaces on top of the MVP. Top nav now exposes Home / Signals / Scanner / Heatmap / Activity / Digest / RiseDualGPT.

**Routes shipped:**
- `/r/scanner` — 10 pattern-detection presets (MACD cross, Bollinger squeeze, EMA golden, volume spike, 52w extremes, RSI overbought/oversold, momentum breakout) with live match table.
- `/r/heatmap` — 24h % change grid (color-banded) + SPDR sector rotation rail. Gracefully degrades when feeders haven't accumulated 24h coverage.
- `/r/activity` — Live polled feed (10s) merging position audit / conflicts / outcomes into severity-tagged event cards. Pulse indicator in header.
- `/r/signals/:id` — Adversarial War Room (Bull / Bear / Commander) + Governance Pipeline (Strategist → Auditor → Synthesized) split. Signal cards on `/r/signals` now link here.

**Client changes:**
- `mc.js`: fixed scanner path (`/scanner/scan?preset_id=X`), agent-activity path (`/agent-activity/feed`), added `scannerPresets`, `sectors`, `signal` calls.
- `Signals.jsx`: signal cards now anchor to `/r/signals/:id` with emerald-hover border.

**Files added:**
- `src/risedual/pages/{Scanner,Heatmap,AgentActivity,SignalDetail}.jsx`

**Verification:** lint clean, compile clean, screenshot tested — signal detail renders header + War Room + Pipeline cleanly with live MC data; scanner shows preset list + scan progress; heatmap correctly degrades when feeders lack 24h coverage.

## 2026-02-13 — Public Site MVP (`/r/*`)

Built the consumer-facing `risedual.ai` surface inside MC's React app
(under `/app/frontend/src/risedual/`) so MC owns both backend AND
frontend for the public product. Alpha can be retired as site host when
DNS is flipped.

**Routes shipped:**
- `/r` — Landing (hero, council, features, CTA)
- `/r/signals` — Live signals + AI council consensus (`GET /api/public/signals`)
- `/r/digest` — LLM narrative + predictions table (`GET /api/public/digest/narrative`, `GET /api/public/digest`)
- `/r/chat` — RiseDualGPT chat panel, Pro Max gated (`POST /api/public/chat`)

**Implementation notes:**
- Distinct fintech aesthetic (dark, emerald accents, Chivo display font) — deliberately *not* the operator terminal look.
- Tier selector in header (Free / Starter / Pro / Pro Max) → drives `X-RiseDual-User-Tier` header. Persisted in localStorage as `risedual_site_tier`. Billing/auth stubbed.
- `X-RiseDual-Token` from `REACT_APP_RISEDUAL_TOKEN` (matches MC's `RISEDUAL_PUBLIC_TOKEN`).
- All elements have `data-testid` with `rd-*` prefix.
- Live API verified: consensus hero, signal cards, direction tags, narrative all render with real MC data.

**Files added:**
- `src/risedual/Layout.jsx`
- `src/risedual/context/TierContext.jsx`
- `src/risedual/lib/mc.js`
- `src/risedual/pages/{Landing,Signals,Digest,Chat}.jsx`
- `src/risedual/README.md`

**Files changed:**
- `src/App.js` — mounted `/r/*` route group
- `frontend/.env` — added `REACT_APP_RISEDUAL_TOKEN`

## 2026-02-13 — Unified Sidecar Convergence Patch shipped to brain agents

Delivered 3-block paste-ready patch (heartbeat loop / sovereign contribution loop / discussion-layer methods) to bring all 4 brains to fully-connected status. REDEYE's discussion layer now actively posting opinions to MC.

## 2026-02-13 — REDEYE Discussion Layer Unblocked

Clarified the dual-router quirk: opinions are **posted** to `/api/ingest/opinion` but **read** from `/api/runtime-discussion/opinions`. REDEYE now successfully posting (5+ opinions in 15 min after fix).

## Earlier (see PRD.md for full history)

- Public API Phase 1 + Phase 2 (signals, digest, chat, narrative, scanner, agent activity, models mind, heatmap) — DONE
